# Terminal Local Chat
***This project is a terminal local chat between two devices where one is hosting (by turning on hotspot) and other is client (by connecting to the turned on hotspot)***.

### How it works?
As the name suggests, it works locally between two devices (Later on this number will be increased), where one turns on [hotspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_hotspot#:~:text=A%20hotspot%20is%20a%20physical,to%20an%20Internet%20service%20provider.), other turns on [WI-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) and connects to the other's hotspot, both run the [jar file](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html), follow the instructions, after all, they can send message from terminal for each other.

To make they communicate themselves, I used server socket, where after one device connect to the other, both sides waits for the received message and print it from a background [Thread](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_threads.asp) and while the background thread waits for the received message, the main thread is sending the message by using socket connections and [streams](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-8-stream) does this conversion from Strings to byte arrays and does the reverse work.

The String before converted to bytes and sent, it's serialized to [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and then converted to bytes and sent, who receives the JSON String only does the reverse work of who sends it (I'm about the codes, not persons).


### Get started
To use of the terminal local chat, you must to:
1. Have two devices (and terminal in them).
2. In both devices, they must have, where one turns on hotspot and other connect to it by WI-FI to run it.
3. Have a [Java Envinronment](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
4. Download a [release](https://github.com/gabrielmjr/terminal-local-chat/releases) jar file (I recommend the latest). [Optionally you can clone the repository and compile it yourself]].
5. Run the jar file by using:
  ```
     java -jar terminal-local-chat_<version>_.jar
  ```
6. The console will show you:
  ```
     Enter your username/nickname: 
  ```
Just enter an username.

***NOTE:*** This user/nick name will be shown in the other device.

7. The console will show you:
```
  Type 1 to be the server (Turn on hotspot).
  Type 2 to be the client (Turn on wifi).
```   

  To the device where hotspot is on, enter 1 and the terminal will show you:
  ```
    >>> Enter the port to listen: 
  ```
  Just choose the port (1024-65535) and wait the other device to tonnect.
  Use the shown data in the device who turned on hotspot, it will be:
  ```
    Serving in ip: [your hotspot ip], port: [choosen port]
  ```

  To the device where other's device hotspot is connected, enter 2 and the terminal will show you:
  ```
    >>> Enter the ip address: 
  ```
  Enter the ip shown in the device where hotspot is on, after that, the terminal will show you;
  ```
    Enter the listened port: 
  ```
  Enter the choosen port and voil√†, they're connected to each other, you're able to send messages, just enter something and it will show you in the other device's terminal.
